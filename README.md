# JHS Lecture Portal

## Project Overview

**JHS Lecture Portal** was developed to address the lack of a centralized system for delivering educational content and resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, each teacher at our school adopted their own methods for distributing materials, which resulted in students spending more time managing resources than actually learning. The JHS Lecture Portal provides a unified platform where students can access all necessary resources in one place.

## Features

- **Backend for Content Addition:** Teachers can add content to the portal through a user-friendly backend interface.
- **Manual Student Verification:** Ensures that only verified students of our school can access the resources.
- **Organized Content Listing:** The frontend displays subjects and their content grouped by weeks, making it easy for students to find what they need.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Hosting:** Digital Ocean
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Operating System:** Linux
